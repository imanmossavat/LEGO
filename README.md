# Reasoning and Abstraction in Large Language Models Trained on a Controlled LEGO Environment

## Introduction

Understanding how large language models (LLMs) reason and abstract is crucial to improving their capabilities and guiding their development toward more intelligent systems. While LLMs have shown impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, their ability to integrate logical reasoning and abstraction remains an open challenge. To study these abilities systematically, it is essential to design controlled environments where LLMs' reasoning processes can be observed and measured in isolation from the complexities of real-world data. One promising approach is to create a simplified, structured world using LEGO blocks, a domain that naturally embodies key concepts such as compositionality, spatial reasoning, and logic.

The use of LEGO as a controlled environment is based on its inherent compositionality, where simple blocks can be assembled into more complex structures and broken down into smaller parts. This mirrors how LLMs learn to combine simple concepts into higher-level abstractions and reasoning. Through the creation of a controlled LEGO environment, we can define tasks that require LLMs to reason spatially, apply logic to complete or transform structures, and learn to abstract higher-level concepts from low-level components.

In this paper, we present an approach where LLMs are trained in a LEGO environment to explore their reasoning and abstraction abilities. By using a custom domain-specific language (DSL), we can programmatically generate LEGO tasks and represent them as graphs or sequences, which can be used to evaluate the models' performance on various tasks such as sequence-to-sequence reasoning, pattern recognition, and logical transformations. This controlled setting allows us to isolate and study specific cognitive abilities, like following instructions or identifying patterns, while eliminating the noise present in real-world data.

Additionally, we explore how this LEGO-based environment can relate to concepts in machine learning, such as symmetries and equivariant networks. LEGO structures often exhibit spatial symmetries, and equivariant networks can be employed to help LLMs generalize across different transformations of these structures. We also consider how reinforcement learning (RL) can be applied to further enhance the model's ability to learn through interaction with the environment, enabling it to optimize its reasoning and decision-making processes.

In summary, the controlled LEGO environment offers a promising framework for studying how LLMs reason and abstract. By systematically designing tasks that challenge models to apply logic and abstraction, we aim to gain insights into the inner workings of LLMs, contributing to the broader goal of developing more intelligent, reasoning-based AI systems. This work builds upon previous efforts in functional programming, such as _Bricklayer: An Authentic Introduction to the Functional Programming Language_ [1], and theoretical approaches to LLMs, including insights from the _ICML Tutorial on the Physics of Language Models_ [2].

## Why LEGO?

LEGO is inherently **compositional**: small bricks combine to create larger structures, and those structures can be broken back into their components. This mirrors how reasoning and abstraction work. By using LEGO, we can design tasks that challenge LLMs to:

1. **Reason Spatially**: Understand how objects fit together or predict what’s missing in a structure.
2. **Abstract**: Learn high-level concepts like "a house" or "a tower" from low-level pieces like individual bricks.
3. **Follow Logic**: Apply rules to transform, complete, or evaluate structures.

Moreover, LEGO models can be represented in ways LLMs can understand, like graphs, sequences, or a custom domain-specific language (DSL).

## The Core Idea: A Controlled World

We create a **controlled LEGO world** where everything is governed by simple, interpretable rules. In this world, we can:

- Build LEGO models programmatically using a custom DSL (similar to Bricklayer).
- Represent these models as graphs or sequences for machine learning tasks.
- Design reasoning challenges, such as completing patterns, predicting next steps, or abstracting components.

This controlled setting lets us isolate specific abilities of LLMs—like following instructions, reasoning over sequences, or composing smaller elements into a whole—without the noise of real-world complexities.

## Example Tasks

Here’s how we might train and evaluate LLMs in this environment:

1. **Sequence-to-Sequence Reasoning**

   - **Input**: A sequence of building instructions (e.g., "Place a red brick at (0, 0), then a blue brick on top").
   - **Output**: Generate the resulting LEGO model as a graph or sequence.
   - **Goal**: Test if the model can understand and follow ordered steps.

2. **Pattern Recognition**

   - **Input**: A series of LEGO structures that follow a pattern, like alternating colors or symmetry.
   - **Output**: Predict the next brick or complete the missing part.
   - **Goal**: See if the model can learn and extend patterns.

3. **Abstraction**

   - **Input**: A complex LEGO structure.
   - **Output**: Break it into logical subcomponents (e.g., walls, roof, base).
   - **Goal**: Evaluate how well the model identifies higher-level abstractions.

4. **Logical Transformations**

   - **Input**: A model and a rule like "Replace all blue bricks with red ones."
   - **Output**: A new model that satisfies the rule.
   - **Goal**: Study how the model applies logic systematically.

## Why Functional Programming?

Functional programming, as used in tools like Bricklayer, is ideal for defining LEGO constructs. It focuses on modular, composable functions that describe patterns and structures clearly. This simplicity aligns with the reasoning tasks we want to explore, like recursion for repeating patterns or transformations for logical reasoning.

## Approach

1. **Design the DSL**  
    Create a simple programming language to define LEGO models. It should allow hierarchical abstraction (e.g., define a “wall” and reuse it to build a “house”).
    
2. **Generate Training Data**  
    Use the DSL to produce diverse LEGO tasks, from simple patterns to complex reasoning challenges. Represent these tasks as graphs or sequences for LLMs.

3. **Train and Test LLMs**  
    Fine-tune LLMs on these structured tasks. Evaluate their performance on:
    - Following instructions.
    - Abstracting patterns.
    - Applying logical rules.

4. **Study Model Behavior**  
    Analyze how the LLM learns in this environment. What patterns does it pick up? How does it reason about new tasks? These insights can inform broader applications of LLMs in reasoning and logic.

## Benefits

This controlled LEGO world provides a playground for understanding LLMs. By simplifying the environment, we can better see how these models learn, abstract, and reason. It also opens the door to designing AI systems that combine statistical learning with logical reasoning, moving closer to truly intelligent systems.

## Relating the Controlled LEGO World to Symmetries and Equivariant Networks

**Symmetries and Equivariance** are key concepts in machine learning, especially when dealing with structured data. In the context of the controlled LEGO environment, these concepts can help improve how models generalize across different configurations of LEGO objects and transformations.

1. **Symmetry in LEGO Models**  
    LEGO structures often exhibit **spatial symmetries**, such as rotation, reflection, and translation. For example:
    - A house built with symmetrical walls will look the same if rotated or flipped.
    - A pattern of bricks may be repeated symmetrically.

    **Equivariant Networks** can be used to leverage these symmetries. These are neural networks designed to respect specific transformations, like rotations or translations. If we train a model to recognize or generate LEGO structures, an equivariant network would ensure that the model can generalize across symmetric transformations. For example, if a model learns to generate a "house," it should also be able to generate the same structure when rotated or mirrored, without retraining the model for each orientation.

2. **Symmetry Grouping in LEGO**  
    The task of **abstraction**—breaking down a complex LEGO model into high-level components (walls, roofs, bases)—can benefit from equivariant networks. These networks can recognize that different components (like two walls of a house) are equivalent under symmetry transformations. This could allow the model to understand that two seemingly different "wall" components are structurally the same, just located in different parts of the space.

## Relating to Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on learning through interaction with an environment, where an agent receives feedback (rewards) to improve its behavior over time. This approach can be highly relevant to the LEGO environment, as it introduces the concept of **active learning and decision-making** in constructing and manipulating LEGO structures.

1. **Task Definition in RL**  
    In the LEGO world, we could frame the construction tasks as **RL problems** where the model (agent) must build or modify structures in a controlled way. For example:
    - **Goal**: Build a stable tower by stacking bricks correctly.
    - **State**: The current configuration of the tower.
    - **Action**: Place a new brick or change the configuration (rotate, move).
    - **Reward**: The reward could be based on how stable the structure is, or how well it follows the sequence of building instructions.

2. **RL for Spatial Reasoning**  
    RL can help train models to understand spatial reasoning tasks within the LEGO environment. For example, an RL agent could learn how to **reason about spatial dependencies**:
    - **Place a brick on top of another**: The model learns which actions (e.g., placing bricks) lead to a stable configuration.
    - **Follow a sequence of building steps**: The agent learns the optimal sequence of actions based on a series of instructions or goals (like building a house from a set of bricks).

3. **Transfer Learning and Generalization in RL**  
    By framing the LEGO environment as an RL task, we could investigate how well models can generalize across various building tasks. For example, a model trained to build a tower could be tested to see if it can apply its learned strategy to build a bridge, taking advantage of the compositional and reusable nature of LEGO blocks.

## Summary

- **Symmetries and Equivariant Networks**: These networks can help models generalize better across transformations in the LEGO world (rotation, reflection, translation). The compositional nature of LEGO allows equivariant networks to recognize and generate symmetrical structures efficiently.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: By framing LEGO construction tasks as RL problems, we can train agents to actively build, reason, and optimize their actions based on rewards. This approach facilitates learning spatial reasoning, sequential task completion, and abstraction, which are key skills for LLMs and AI systems.

In this way, combining **symmetries, equivariant networks, and RL** in the LEGO-controlled world provides a powerful framework for studying and training models in compositional reasoning, abstraction, and spatial intelligence.
